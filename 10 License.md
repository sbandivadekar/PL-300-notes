# 🔐 Power BI Licensing — Explained Simply

Power BI licensing controls **who can create**, **who can share**, and **who can view** content.

There are **4 main license types** you must know:

1. **Free**
2. **Pro**
3. **Premium Per User (PPU)**
4. **Premium Capacity (P SKU)**

---
## 1️⃣ Power BI **Free** License

### ✅ What it is

Entry-level license for **viewing content**.

### ✔ What Free users CAN do

- View reports & dashboards **in Premium capacity**
- Consume shared content (read-only)
- Use **My Workspace** (personal only)
### ❌ What Free users CANNOT do

- Share reports or dashboards
- Publish apps
- Collaborate in shared (non-premium) workspaces
- Create or edit content for others

### 🧠 Key Rule

> **Free users can view content ONLY if it’s in Premium capacity**

## 2️⃣ Power BI **Pro** License

### ✅ What it is

Standard license for **creators & collaborators**.

### ✔ What Pro users CAN do

- Create reports & dashboards

- Publish Power BI Apps
- Schedule refresh
- Use **shared (non-premium) workspaces**
### ❌ Limitations

### 🧠 Key Rule

> **Both creator and viewer must have Pro**  
> _(unless workspace is Premium)_

---
## 3️⃣ Power BI **Premium Per User (PPU)**

### ✅ What it is

Pro + **Premium features**, but **licensed per user**.

### ✔ What PPU users CAN do

Everything Pro can do **PLUS**:

- XMLA read/write
- Deployment pipelines

### ❌ Important Limitation

- Only **PPU users can view PPU workspace content**
- Free or Pro users **cannot consume PPU content**

### 🧠 Key Rule

> **PPU workspace → PPU users only**

---
## 4️⃣ Power BI **Premium Capacity (P SKU)**

### ✅ What it is

Dedicated capacity for the **organization**, not per user.

### ✔ What Premium Capacity enables

- High performance & scalability
- Large datasets
- Paginated reports
- Deployment pipelines

# Power BI License vs Capacity — Explained Correctly

## 1️⃣ License and Capacity are **Independent**

### ✅ Correct Statement

> **Licensing and Capacity are independent concepts in Power BI.**

- **Capacity** is purchased by the **organization**
- **Licenses** are assigned to **users**
- A user **does NOT need a Power BI license to purchase Premium capacity**
    - (Usually done by a tenant/global admin)

### 🧠 Meaning

- Capacity = **compute & performance**
- License = **what a user is allowed to do**

---

## 2️⃣ Buying Capacity Alone Is NOT Enough

### ✅ Correct Statement

> **Even if you buy Premium capacity, users still need licenses to create or manage content.**
